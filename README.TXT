This is a README

3 New Premade Recipea were included in the RecipeBook project. By opening the main.java file in any other IDE than BlueJ, the RecipeAdder will run, allowing the user to add a new Recipe to RecipeBook. (Something to pay attention to is that you need to open the entire file, and not only select the main, since doing so will result in the program not running properly from the lack of the rest of the java files)
